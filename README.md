Diabetes Prediction using Linear Regression
📌 Overview
This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts diabetes progression using Linear Regression. The dataset is taken from scikit-learn's diabetes dataset.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the Diabetes Dataset from scikit-learn, which contains 10 features collected from 442 patients. The target variable represents a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

🔥 Steps Performed
Loaded the dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes()
Preprocessed the data (feature selection, normalization, splitting)
Trained a Linear Regression model using LinearRegression() from sklearn
Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score
Plotted the results to visualize predictions vs actual values
📝 Results
Model achieved an R² score of X.XX (replace with your actual score)
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) was X.XX (replace with actual value)
